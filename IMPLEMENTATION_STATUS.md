---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. ‚úÖ Sidebar Financial Metrics Removal for Loan Officer
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Files Modified:**
- `resources/views/components/sidebar.blade.php`

**Changes:**
- Wrapped entire financial metrics section in role check: `@if($role !== 'loan_officer' && $role !== 'borrower')`
- Removed all these sections from loan officer view:
  - Portfolio Overview (Due Today, Overdue, Active Loans, Requests)
  - Financial Performance (Released Principal, Outstanding, Interest, Repayments)
  - Portfolio at Risk (14-Day PAR, 30-Day PAR, Total PAR)
  - Client Base metrics
- Metrics now only display for `admin` and `branch_manager` roles

**Result:** Loan officer sidebar is now clean and focused on their specific tasks

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Loan Repayments Added to Sidebar
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Files Modified:**
- `resources/views/components/sidebar.blade.php`

**Changes:**
- Added new "Collections" section for loan officers
- Added "Loan Repayments" menu item with route to `loan-repayments.index`
- Added "Collections" menu item with route to `collections.index`
- Both pages support real-time data (existing functionality)

**Menu Structure for Loan Officer:**
```
Client Management
  - My Clients
  - KYC Documents

Loan Operations
  - Loan Applications
  - My Loans
  - Collaterals

Collections
  - Loan Repayments ‚Üê NEW
  - Collections ‚Üê MOVED HERE
```

---

### 3. ‚úÖ KYC Documents & Collaterals Access for Loan Officers
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Files Modified:**
- `resources/views/components/sidebar.blade.php`

**Changes:**
- Added "KYC Documents" link in Client Management section
- Added "Collaterals" link in Loan Operations section
- Both modules require approval from branch manager/admin (existing workflow preserved)

**Loan Officer Can Now:**
- Upload KYC documents for clients
- Create/edit collateral entries for loans
- View all KYC and collateral records for their clients
- Submit for approval (branch manager/admin approves)

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Interest Calculation Updated to Simple Interest
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Files Modified:**
- `app/Models/Loan.php`
- `app/Services/LoanCalculationService.php`

**OLD Calculation (Amortization/Compound):**
```php
// Example: $10,000 at 10% annual rate for 12 months
$monthlyRate = 10% / 12 = 0.833% per month
Monthly Payment = $879.16 (using amortization formula)
Total Paid = $10,549.92
Interest = $549.92
```

**NEW Calculation (Simple Interest):**
```php
// Example: $10,000 at 10% interest
Interest = $10,000 √ó (10 / 100) = $1,000
Total Amount = $10,000 + $1,000 = $11,000
Monthly Payment = $11,000 √∑ 12 = $916.67
```

**Changes in Loan.php:**
- `calculateTotalInterest()` - Now uses: `amount √ó (interest_rate / 100)`
- `calculateTotalAmount()` - Returns: `amount + interest`
- `calculateMonthlyPayment()` - Returns: `total_amount √∑ term_months`

**Changes in LoanCalculationService.php:**
- `updateLoanCalculations()` - Now calls `calculateSimpleInterest()` instead of `calculateAmortizationSchedule()`
- Creates simple repayment schedule with equal monthly payments
- Interest is distributed equally across all months

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ All new loans will use simple interest calculation
- ‚úÖ Existing loans remain unchanged (backward compatible)
- ‚úÖ More transparent and easier to understand for borrowers
- ‚úÖ Interest amount is predictable and fixed

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Profile Page Verification
**Status:** COMPLETE - Already Functional
**Files Verified:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/ProfileController.php`
- `resources/views/profile/edit.blade.php`
- `resources/views/profile/partials/update-profile-information-form.blade.php`
- `resources/views/profile/partials/update-password-form.blade.php`
- `resources/views/profile/partials/delete-user-form.blade.php`

**Available Functionality:**
- ‚úÖ Update profile information (name, email)
- ‚úÖ Change password
- ‚úÖ Delete account
- ‚úÖ Email verification
- ‚úÖ Works for all roles (Admin, Branch Manager, Loan Officer, Borrower)

**Route:** `/profile` or `profile.edit`

## üîÑ REMAINING TASKS

### 6. üîÑ Loan Officer Dashboard Data Scoping (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Issue:** Dashboard currently shows branch-wide data, should show personal data only

**Required Changes:**
File: `app/Http/Controllers/LoanOfficerDashboardController.php`

**Current Behavior:**
- Shows all loans in the branch
- Shows branch-wide metrics
- Includes data from other loan officers

**Desired Behavior:**
- Show only loans created by or assigned to the logged-in loan officer
- Show personal portfolio metrics
- Show personal collection targets
- Show personal performance data

**Implementation Required:**
```php
// Add to all queries in LoanOfficerDashboardController
$loans = Loan::where(function($q) {
    $q->where('created_by', auth()->id())
      ->orWhere('assigned_to', auth()->id());
})
->where('branch_id', auth()->user()->branch_id)
->get();

// Update analytics to filter by loan officer
$analytics = $analyticsService->getComprehensiveAnalytics(
    $branchId,
    auth()->id() // Add loan officer filter
);
```

**Files to Update:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/LoanOfficerDashboardController.php`
- `app/Services/FinancialAnalyticsService.php` (add loan officer parameter)

---

### 7. üîÑ Real-Time Loan Application Form (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Issue:** Loan applications don't submit in real-time, page reloads required

**Required Implementation:**
1. Create Livewire component for loan application
2. Add real-time validation
3. Auto-calculate interest as user types
4. Show immediate feedback
5. Broadcast to dashboard when submitted

**Files to Create:**
- `app/Livewire/LoanApplicationForm.php`
- `resources/views/livewire/loan-application-form.blade.php`

**Files to Update:**
- `resources/views/loan-applications/create.blade.php` (embed Livewire component)

**Features to Include:**
- Client autocomplete search
- Real-time interest calculation display
- Principal + Interest = Total (show as user types)
- Monthly payment preview
- Term slider with live updates
- Collateral selection (optional)
- KYC verification check

3. **Implement real-time loan application** - Better UX
4. **Add loan officer performance tracking** - Personal metrics

### Long-term Actions (Low Priority):
5. **Consider config option** - Allow switching between simple and compound interest
6. **Add interest calculation documentation** - Help borrowers understand
7. **Create loan calculator tool** - Public-facing for estimates

## üîß KNOWN ISSUES

### Minor Issues:
1. **CRLF warnings** - Line ending differences (cosmetic, not functional)
2. **Loan officer dashboard** - Shows branch data instead of personal data
3. **No real-time updates** - Loan application form requires page reload

### No Known Bugs:

- No breaking changes introduced
- Backward compatible with existing data

---

## üìù NOTES FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

### Interest Calculation:
- Old amortization method still available in `LoanCalculationService::calculateAmortizationSchedule()`
- Can be used for advanced reporting or comparison
- Consider adding a setting to toggle between methods per loan product

### Real-Time Features:
- Livewire components already used in other parts (branch manager collections)
- Can follow same pattern for loan applications
- Broadcasting infrastructure in place

### Data Scoping:
- Add `assigned_to` column to loans table if not exists
- Consider adding team/group assignment for loan officers
- Implement load balancing for client distribution
