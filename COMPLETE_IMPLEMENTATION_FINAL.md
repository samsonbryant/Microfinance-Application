## 💡 KEY IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Simple Interest Transparency

```
$10,000 at 10% for 12 months = $549.92 interest (varies by duration)
```

**New:** Simple percentage
```
$10,000 at 10% = $1,000 interest (fixed)
Duration: Doesn't affect interest amount
Monthly Payment: Total ÷ Term
```

### 2. Real-Time Workflow
**Old:** Static forms with page reloads
```
Submit → Reload → Wait → Check status → Reload
```

**New:** Real-time Livewire
```
Submit → Instant feedback → Live updates → No reload needed
All parties notified instantly at each step
```

### 3. Role-Based UX
**Old:** All users saw similar interfaces

**New:** Tailored experience
```
Borrower: Simple, clean, focused on loans
Loan Officer: Operational tools only
Branch Manager: Collections + approvals
Admin: Complete system visibility
```
