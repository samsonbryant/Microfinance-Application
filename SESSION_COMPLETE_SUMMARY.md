## ✅ TASK 3: INTEREST CALCULATION - SIMPLE INTEREST

### What Was Changed:
**Before (Compound/Amortization):**
```
$10,000 at 10% for 12 months
= $549.92 interest (varies by duration)
```

```
$10,000 at 10% = $1,000 interest
(Duration doesn't affect interest amount)
```

### Files Modified:
- `app/Models/Loan.php`
  - `calculateTotalInterest()` - Now: `amount × (rate / 100)`
  - `calculateTotalAmount()` - Now: `principal + interest`
  - `calculateMonthlyPayment()` - Now: `total_amount ÷ term`

- `app/Services/LoanCalculationService.php`
  - `updateLoanCalculations()` - Now uses `calculateSimpleInterest()`

### Impact:
✅ Interest is ONLY percentage of principal

## 💡 KEY TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Interest Calculation System:
```php
// OLD (Complex)
Interest varies by duration using amortization formula

// NEW (Simple)  
Interest = Principal × (Rate ÷ 100)
Example: $5,000 × (12 ÷ 100) = $600
Total: $5,600
Monthly (12 months): $466.67
```

### 2. Real-Time Data Architecture:
```
User Action → Controller → Service → Database
     ↓
Observer/Event → Broadcast
     ↓
Livewire Component → Auto-Refresh → UI Update
```

### 3. Permission-Based Sidebar:
```php
Admin → Sees ALL accounting modules
Branch Manager → Sees branch operations + limited accounting
Loan Officer → Sees only operational tools (no financial metrics)
Borrower → Sees personal account only
```

## 💰 INTEREST CALCULATION EXAMPLES

### Simple Interest Formula (NEW):
```
Interest = Principal × (Rate ÷ 100)
Total Amount = Principal + Interest
Monthly Payment = Total Amount ÷ Term
```

### Real Examples:

**Example 1:**
```
Principal: $10,000
Rate: 10%
Term: 12 months

Interest = $10,000 × (10 ÷ 100) = $1,000
Total = $10,000 + $1,000 = $11,000
Monthly = $11,000 ÷ 12 = $916.67
```

**Example 2:**
```
Principal: $5,000
Rate: 15%
Term: 6 months

Interest = $5,000 × (15 ÷ 100) = $750
Total = $5,000 + $750 = $5,750
Monthly = $5,750 ÷ 6 = $958.33
```

**Example 3:**
```
Principal: $20,000
Rate: 8%
Term: 24 months

Interest = $20,000 × (8 ÷ 100) = $1,600
Total = $20,000 + $1,600 = $21,600
Monthly = $21,600 ÷ 24 = $900.00
```

**Key Point:** Interest amount is FIXED and doesn't change based on loan duration!
