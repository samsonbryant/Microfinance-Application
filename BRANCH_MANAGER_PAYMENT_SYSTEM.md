# Branch Manager Payment & Collections System - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive payment and collections system implemented for Branch Managers with real-time data updates and quick payment processing capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Real-Time Collections Dashboard (Livewire Component)
**Location:** `app/Livewire/BranchManagerCollections.php`

#### Features:
- **Real-time data updates** every 30 seconds
- **Four collection views:**
  - Due Today
  - Overdue Loans
  - Upcoming Payments (30 days)
  - All Active Loans
- **Live statistics cards** showing:
  - Count and amount for each category
  - Auto-refreshing metrics
- **Inline payment processing** without page reload
- **Branch-specific data filtering**

#### Key Methods:
```php
- mount()                    // Initialize component
- selectTab($tab)           // Switch between collection views
- openPaymentModal($loanId) // Open payment form
- processPayment()          // Process loan payment
- getDueToday()             // Get loans due today
- getOverdue()              // Get overdue loans
- getUpcoming()             // Get upcoming payments
- getAllActive()            // Get all active loans
- getStats()                // Get real-time statistics
```

#### New Features Added:
1. **Collections & Payments Button**
   - Quick access to dedicated collections page
   - Prominent placement in dashboard header

2. **Quick Payment Buttons**
   - Added to "Today's Collections" table
   - Each loan has:
     - View Details button
     - Quick Payment button

3. **Quick Payment Modal**
   - Opens directly on dashboard
   - Pre-filled with loan information
   - Shows:
     - Loan number and client name
     - Outstanding balance
     - Next payment amount
   - Payment form with:
     - Amount (pre-filled)
     - Payment method (cash, bank transfer, mobile money, cheque)
     - Payment date
     - Reference number (optional)
     - Notes (optional)

4. **JavaScript Integration**
   - `initializeQuickPayment()` function
   - Modal auto-population
   - Bootstrap modal integration

### 3. Dedicated Collections Page
**Location:** `resources/views/branch-manager/collections.blade.php`

#### Features:
- Full-page collections interface
- Embeds Livewire collections component
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Link to payment history
- Success/error flash messages
- SweetAlert integration for notifications

### 4. Payment Processing Controller
**Location:** `app/Http/Controllers/BranchManagerDashboardController.php`

#### New Methods Added:

##### `collections()`
- Displays dedicated collections page
- Returns view with Livewire component

##### `processPayment(Request $request)`
- Validates payment data
- Verifies loan belongs to branch manager's branch
- Creates transaction record
- Updates loan balance and status
- Handles loan completion
- Updates next due date
- Logs activity
- Returns success/error messages

**Validation Rules:**
```php
- loan_id: required|exists:loans,id
- amount: required|numeric|min:0.01
- payment_method: required|in:cash,bank_transfer,mobile_money,cheque
- payment_date: required|date
- reference_number: nullable|string|max:100
- notes: nullable|string|max:500
```

### 5. Routes Configuration
**Location:** `routes/web.php`

#### New Routes Added:
```php
// Collections page
Route::get('/branch-manager/collections', 
    [BranchManagerDashboardController::class, 'collections'])
    ->name('branch-manager.collections');

// Process payment
Route::post('/branch-manager/process-payment', 
    [BranchManagerDashboardController::class, 'processPayment'])
    ->name('branch-manager.process-payment');
```

**Middleware:** `role:branch_manager` (already applied to route group)

## How It Works

### 1. Accessing Collections
Branch managers can access the collections system in two ways:

**Option A: From Dashboard**
1. Click "Collections & Payments" button in dashboard header
2. Opens dedicated collections page

**Option B: Quick Payment from Dashboard**
1. View "Today's Collections" section
2. Click dollar sign button on any loan
3. Quick payment modal opens
4. Fill in payment details
5. Submit payment

### 2. Processing a Payment

#### Step-by-Step Flow:
1. **User selects loan** (via quick payment or collections page)
2. **System loads loan data:**
   - Loan number
   - Client information
   - Outstanding balance
   - Next payment amount
3. **User enters payment details:**
   - Amount (defaults to next payment amount)
   - Payment method
   - Payment date (defaults to today)
   - Optional reference number
   - Optional notes
4. **System validates:**
   - Loan exists and belongs to branch
   - Loan status is active or overdue
   - Amount is valid
   - Required fields are filled
5. **System processes payment:**
   - Creates transaction record with unique number (REP + date + random)
   - Updates loan outstanding balance
   - Updates total paid amount
   - Changes status to 'completed' if fully paid
   - Updates last payment date
   - Adjusts next due date if necessary
6. **System logs activity:**
   - Records who processed payment
   - Records amount and loan details
7. **User receives confirmation:**
   - Success message with transaction number
   - Updated loan statistics
   - Refreshed collections data

### 3. Real-Time Data Updates

#### Automatic Refresh:
- **Collections page:** Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- **Dashboard:** Manual refresh button available
- **Statistics:** Updated after each payment

#### Livewire Events:
- `refreshCollections`: Refreshes component data
- `payment-processed`: Triggers after successful payment

### 4. Security Features

#### Access Control:
- Routes protected by `role:branch_manager` middleware
- Payment processor verifies loan belongs to manager's branch
- Transaction logging for audit trail

#### Data Validation:
- Server-side validation for all inputs
- CSRF protection on all forms
- Database transactions with rollback on error

## Database Impact

### Tables Modified:
1. **transactions**
   - New records created for each payment
   - Fields: transaction_number, client_id, loan_id, type, amount, etc.

2. **loans**
   - Updated fields:
     - outstanding_balance (reduced by payment amount)
     - total_paid (increased by payment amount)
     - status (may change to 'completed')
     - last_payment_date (updated to payment date)
     - next_due_date (may be updated or nullified)

3. **activity_log**
   - New activity records for audit trail

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Handling:
1. **Loan not found:** Returns error message
2. **Unauthorized access:** Checks branch ownership
3. **Invalid loan status:** Verifies loan can accept payments
4. **Database error:** Rolls back transaction, logs error
5. **Validation failure:** Returns with error messages

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Eager Loading:** Loads client relationship with loans
2. **Query Filtering:** Branch-specific filtering at database level
3. **Pagination:** For "All Active" loans view
4. **Auto-refresh:** Only statistics, not full page reload
5. **Database Transactions:** Ensures data integrity

Although this is primarily a web-based system, the Livewire component communicates via:

### Livewire Endpoints:
- `POST /livewire/message/branch-manager-collections` - Component updates
- Internal method calls for:
  - selectTab
  - openPaymentModal
  - processPayment
  - $refresh

### Traditional Routes:
- `GET /branch-manager/collections` - Collections page

- `GET /branch-manager/dashboard/realtime` - Real-time dashboard data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Issue:** Payment modal doesn't open
- **Solution:** Check JavaScript console for errors, verify Bootstrap is loaded

**Issue:** Real-time updates not working
- **Solution:** Verify Livewire is properly configured, check browser console

**Issue:** Payment fails without error
- **Solution:** Check Laravel logs, verify database connectivity

**Issue:** Unauthorized access errors
- **Solution:** Verify user has branch_manager role and branch_id is set
