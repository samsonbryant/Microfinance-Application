## 🔄 REAL-TIME FEATURES

### 1. Livewire Loan Application Form

**Component:** `App\Livewire\BorrowerLoanApplication`

**Real-Time Capabilities:**
- `wire:model.live="amount"` - Amount updates instantly

**Calculation Logic (Simple Interest):**
```php
Interest = Principal × (Rate ÷ 100)
Total = Principal + Interest
Monthly = Total ÷ Term

Example:
$5,000 at 12% for 12 months
Interest = $5,000 × (12 ÷ 100) = $600
Total = $5,000 + $600 = $5,600
Monthly = $5,600 ÷ 12 = $466.67
```

**Events Used:**
- `LoanApplicationSubmitted` - When borrower submits
- `LoanReviewed` - When loan officer reviews
- `LoanApprovedEvent` - When branch manager approves
- `LoanDisbursed` - When admin disburses
