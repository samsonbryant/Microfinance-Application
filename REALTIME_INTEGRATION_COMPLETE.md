### 2. **Automatic Accounting Integration** (Loan ↔ Accounting)

#### A. Loan Disbursement Observer (`LoanObserver.php`)

**When a loan is disbursed, automatically:**
1. ✅ Creates Transfer entry
   - From: Bank Account (1100)
   - To: Loan Portfolio (1200)
   - Amount: Loan amount
   - Type: Disbursement
   - Status: Auto-posted

2. ✅ Creates Revenue entry for processing fee (if any)
   - Account: Processing Fee Income (4200)
   - Type: processing_fee
   - Status: Auto-posted

3. ✅ Broadcasts `loan.disbursed` event for real-time updates

**Example:**
```
Loan #L2025001 disbursed for $5,000
→ Creates Transfer: Bank → Loan Portfolio ($5,000)
→ Creates Revenue: Processing Fee ($100)
→ Posts to General Ledger automatically
→ Updates account balances in real-time
```

#### B. Loan Repayment Observer (`LoanRepaymentObserver.php`)

**When a payment is made, automatically:**
1. ✅ Creates Revenue entry for interest
   - Account: Loan Interest Income (4000)
   - Type: interest_received
   - Links to loan & client
   - Status: Auto-posted

2. ✅ Creates Revenue entry for penalties (if any)
   - Account: Penalty Income (4100)
   - Type: default_charges
   - Status: Auto-posted

3. ✅ Broadcasts `payment.processed` event

**Example:**
```
Payment of $550 received
→ Principal: $500
→ Interest: $45
→ Penalty: $5

Automatically creates:
- Revenue Entry #REV20250116001: Interest $45
- Revenue Entry #REV20250116002: Penalty $5
- Posts both to General Ledger
- Updates P&L report in real-time
```

### 3. **Broadcasting Events** (Real-Time System Updates)

**New Events Created:**
- ✅ `LoanDisbursed` - When loan is disbursed
- ✅ `LoanUpdated` - When loan status changes
- ✅ `PaymentProcessed` - When payment is made

**Broadcast Channels:**
- `client.{client_id}` - Updates borrower dashboard
- `branch.{branch_id}` - Updates branch dashboards
- `accounting` - Updates accounting dashboards/reports

**Real-Time Flow:**

Expense::observe(ExpenseObserver::class);
Transfer::observe(TransferObserver::class);
RevenueEntry::observe(RevenueEntryObserver::class);
JournalEntry::observe(JournalEntryObserver::class);

// Loan-Accounting Integration
