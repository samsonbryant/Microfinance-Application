## 📞 SUPPORT & TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Questions:

**Q: How do I test the real-time features?**
A: Open two browser windows, login as different roles, perform actions in one and watch updates in the other.

**Q: Interest calculation seems different from before**
A: Correct! We changed to simple interest (percentage of principal only). Duration no longer affects interest amount.

**Q: Where are the financial reports for borrowers?**
A: Removed by design. Borrowers see transaction history instead. Full reports are for admin/branch managers only.

**Q: How long does loan approval take?**
A: Technically instant once each person acts. Realistically: 24-48 hours with real-time visibility.

**Q: Can I track my application?**
A: Yes! Check "My Loans" - you'll see status badge and receive notifications at each step.
