## üîß Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. **Loan Disbursement Memory Exhaustion** ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Infinite observer loops causing memory crash  
**Fix:** Added `withoutEvents()` wrapper in `LoanCalculationService`  
**Result:** Disbursement works perfectly without errors

### 2. **Dashboard Sidebar Showing Zeros/NaN** ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Wrong field names and missing status filters  
**Fix:** 
- Changed `next_payment_date` ‚Üí `next_due_date`
- Added 'disbursed' status to all queries
- Added null coalescing (`?? 0`) throughout  
**Result:** All metrics show real-time accurate data

### 3. **Approval Workflow Database Error** ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Missing columns in `approval_workflows` table  
**Fix:** Created migration to add required columns  
**Columns Added:** loan_id, level, approver_id, status, comments, etc.  
**Result:** Workflow creation works properly

### 4. **KYC Documents Soft Delete Error** ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Missing `deleted_at` column  
**Fix:** Created and ran migration to add soft deletes  
**Result:** KYC documents support soft deletes

### 5. **DataTables Warnings** ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Initializing DataTables on placeholder tables  
**Fix:** Added conditional check to skip empty tables  
**Result:** No more column count warnings

### 6. **Interest Calculation** ‚úÖ
**Added:** Simple interest method focusing only on principal √ó rate  
**Formula:** `Interest = Principal √ó (Interest Rate / 100)`  
**Maintains:** Full amortization schedule for payment tracking
