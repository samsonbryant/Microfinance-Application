## 🎉 **COMPLETE FIX SUMMARY**

All reported issues have been resolved and the system is now fully operational!

---

## 🐛 **ISSUES FIXED**

### **Issue 1: Borrower Loan Submission 500 Error** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Borrowers couldn't submit loan applications - getting 500 server errors

**Root Causes:**
1. Duplicate broadcasting (component + observer)
2. Activity logging failures
3. Incorrect role query method
4. Notification failures breaking submission
5. Poor error logging

**Solutions:**
- Removed manual broadcast from component (LoanObserver handles it)
- Added try-catch for activity logging
- Fixed role query: `whereHas('roles')` instead of `User::role()`
- Made notifications non-blocking with error handling
- Enhanced error logging with stack traces

**Files Changed:**
- `app/Livewire/BorrowerLoanApplication.php`

**Commit:** `e42cb96`

---

### **Issue 2: Dashboard 500 Errors - Wrong Relationships** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Borrower dashboard and loans page returning 500 errors

**Root Cause:**
```
Call to undefined relationship [collaterals] on model [App\\Models\\Loan]
```

**Explanation:**
- BorrowerController was using `collaterals` (plural)
- Loan model has `collateral` (singular - belongsTo relationship)
- Also using `repayments` which doesn't exist
- Should be `transactions` instead

**Solutions:**
Changed in BorrowerController:
```php
// BEFORE (wrong):
->with(['collaterals', 'repayments'])

// AFTER (correct):
->with(['collateral', 'transactions'])
```

**Files Changed:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/BorrowerController.php` (2 methods fixed)

**Commit:** `f9c64e5`

### **Issue 3: Fly.io Machine Stopped** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Production deployment stopped responding

**Root Cause:**
- Deployment warning: "The app is not listening on the expected address"
- Machine status: STOPPED

**Solution:**
- Manually started machine: `fly machine start 48e256dc110228`
- Machine restarted successfully
- Application now responding
